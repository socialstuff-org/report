\subsection{Services}

The following part of the dossier will describe the different services which have been developed during the time of the project.
This will include a description of each service, followed by an REST API specification.

\subsubsection{API Service}
% TODO @joernneumeyer & @mauritsvanderzee

\subsubsection{Auth Service}
% TODO @joernneumeyer & @mauritsvanderzee

\subsubsection{Contact Service}
% TODO @joernneumeyer & @mauritsvanderzee

\subsubsection{Debug Service?}
% TODO @joernneumeyer & @mauritsvanderzee
% @joernneumeyer shall we include debug service?

\subsubsection{Crypto Storage Service}

\subsection{Components}

\section{Backend}

\subsection{Database Connections}

\subsection{Services}

\subsubsection{Authentication Service}
% TODO @joernneumeyer

\subsubsection{File Service}
% TODO @all shall we just briefly mention that this might be a service for future features / development

\subsubsection{Identity Service}
\label{subsubsec:identitySer}
% TODO @joernneumeyer

\subsubsection{Settings Service}
\label{subsubsec:settingsSer}
% TODO @maltecastner & tobiasjansen
The Settings service provides an interface to the admin panel frontend and carries out the settings to the other services.
This service was developed in parallel to the admin panel frontend. %TODO @maltecastner insert reference to component, once it has been added
First only the for the UI necessary functionality would be added, later on the actual functionality was added (e.g.\ that users can actually be reported for the report reasons added in the settings)
As visible from the use case diagram~\ref{fig:ucd} the Settings service carries out a few tasks by itself whilst forwarding
certain other request to the identity ~\ref{subsubsec:identitySer} and the reporting~\ref{subsubsec:reportingSer} service.
The use cases and their descriptions can be found on in the online documentation.

    \label{fig:ucd}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Rest interface}
The settings service provides the following rest endpoints:

\begin{verbatim}
GET: /settings/report-reason
\end{verbatim}

Returns all report reasons as a JSON array.

\begin{verbatim}
POST: /settings/report-reason
body:
{
"reason": "some reason",
"max_report_violations": 5
}
\end{verbatim}
adds a new report reason.

\begin{verbatim}
PUT: /settings/report-reason
body:
{
"id": 123,
"reason": "some reason",
"max_report_violations": 5
}
\end{verbatim}
Edits an existing report reason.


\begin{verbatim}
DELETE: /settings/report-reason
headers:
- "id": 123
\end{verbatim}

Deletes a report reason with an id that is provided as a header.

\begin{verbatim}
GET: /settings/security
\end{verbatim}

returns the current security settings.

\begin{verbatim}
PUT: /settings/security
body:
{
    "two_factor_auth": {
    "on" : true,
    "phone": false,
    "email": true
},
    "confirmed_emails_only": true,
    "individual_pwd_req": {
    "on": true,
    "upper_case": true,
    "number": true,
    "special_char": true,
    "reg_ex": false,
    "reg_ex_string": "[]"
},
    "inv_only": {
        "on": false,
        "inv_only_by_adm": false
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
Edits the security settings.
The new settings are provided in body.

##Example Add Report reason
\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./images/SequenceDiagram_AddReportReason.pdf}
    \caption{Use case diagram of the admin panel showing responsibility of each AP service}
    \label{fig:addReportReason}
\end{figure}
The sequence diagram~\ref{fig:addReportReason} shows an example of the communication of the settings service with the aforementioned services.
Firstly by checking at the identity service, if the user who sent out the request is in fact an administrator and then adding the reason in the reporting service.
This way each service has a clearly defined task.

\subsubsection{Reporting Service}
\label{subsubsec:reportingSer}
% TODO @maltecastner & tobiasjansen
The reporting service handles the reporting system.
This includes administrative tasks like managing for which reasons
users can be reported, as well as the reporting system itself (reporting users and banning them).
The administrative tasks, like adding new report reasons, manually blocking and unblocking users, can be done via the
settings service~\ref{subsubsec:settingsSer}.

\paragraph{Rest Interface}
\begin{verbatim}
POST: /report-reasons
body:
{
    "reason": "some reason",
    "max_report_violations": 5
}
\end{verbatim}
Adds a new report reason returning the id of the added report reason.

\begin{verbatim}
PUT: /report-reasons
body:
{
    "id": 12
    "reason": "some reason",
    "max_report_violations": 5
}
\end{verbatim}
Edits a report reason by the "id" key and returns the edited reason.

\begin{verbatim}
GET: /report-reasons
\end{verbatim}
Returns all existing report reasons as JSON array

\begin{verbatim}
DELETE: /report-reasons
headers
    - id: 12
\end{verbatim}
Deletes a report reason by id which is provided in the header of the request.
Returns the id of the deleted request in its body.

\begin{verbatim}
Headers:
    - user_token
Body:
{
    "username": "userHashOfUserBeingReported",
    "reason_id": 123
}
\end{verbatim}
Reports a user based of the report reason and the users username hash.
A user can only be reported by a the same user for the same reason after 15 minutes to prevent spamming.
Otherwise the report will be processed by the backend and the user set to "blocked" should he exceed the maximum report violation counter.
