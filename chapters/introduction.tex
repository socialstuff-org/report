Introduction 

In this document we will describe our process for the duration of the SoFa project. And also talk about the goal of this project and its related components 

Context 

In this current day and age of Social media and its centralized structure, there is very little room for privacy and one could argue that there are even forms of censorship taking place, even encrypted chat applications fall victim to privacy breaches from governments in countries where these applications are run from. SocialStuff aims to combat this trend by providing a thoroughly encrypted chat application which is of a decentralized nature, aiming to be independent of whatever country its run from.

A working prototype both mobile and desktop versions
