\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:summary}
In this current day and age of social media and its centralized structure, there is very little room for privacy and
one could argue that there are even forms of censorship taking place, even encrypted chat applications fall victim to
privacy breaches from governments in countries where these applications are run from.
Trale aims to combat this trend by providing a thoroughly encrypted chat application which is of a decentralized
nature, aiming to be independent of whatever country its run from.
